The example project is intended to be used with the NFC Reader Library directly.
It does not make use of Neard and NeardAL.
Before running it, please make sure that the daemon neard-explorenfc is not running.

Follow these steps to compile and run the example.

	1. Download SW282816 from the EXPLORE-NFC website
	2. Extract the file with the command
       unzip SW282816.zip
	3. Extract the sources with the command
       tar -xvf neard-explorenfc_0.9.orig.tar.gz
	4. Install dependencies:
       sudo apt-get install wiringpi autoconf libtool libglib2.0-dev
	5. Install NeardAL development libraries
       sudo dpkg -i libneardal-dev_0.14.2-1_armhf.deb
    6. Enter the directory neard-explorenfc-0.9 with
       cd neard-explorenfc-0.9
	7. Run the command
       ./bootstrap
	8. Export environment variables for wiringPi with the commands
       export WIRINGPI_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include
       export WIRINGPI_LIBS=-L/usr/lib\ -lwiringPi
	8. Run
       ./configure
	9. Finally compile with
       make
   10. Copy the resulting library with
       sudo cp nxprdlib/libnxprdlib.a /usr/local/lib/
   11. Compile the example with
       gcc -o read-hce read-hce.c -Itypes -Iintfs -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lwiringPi -lnxprdlib
   12. Run the program with
       sudo ./read-hce
