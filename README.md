# NfcReaderlibrary

## Branch raspberrypi
Contains examples intended to be run on the Raspberry Pi using the EXPLORE-NFC [1] extension board.

Examples hosted in this branch are working with the Raspbian Jessie image.
All examples are using the NFC Reader Library as an external library. To build the library, please follow these steps:

1. Download SW282816 from the EXPLORE-NFC website
2. Extract the file with the command
   unzip SW282816.zip
3. Extract the sources with the command
   tar -xvf neard-explorenfc_0.9.orig.tar.gz
4. Install dependencies:
   sudo apt-get install wiringpi autoconf libtool libglib2.0-dev
5. Install NeardAL development libraries
   sudo dpkg -i libneardal-dev_0.14.2-1_armhf.deb
6. Enter the directory neard-explorenfc-0.9 with
   cd neard-explorenfc-0.9
7. Run the command
   ./bootstrap
8. Export environment variables for wiringPi with the commands
   export WIRINGPI_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include
   export WIRINGPI_LIBS=-L/usr/lib\ -lwiringPi
8. Run
   ./configure
9. Finally compile with
   make
10. Copy the resulting library with
   sudo cp nxprdlib/libnxprdlib.a /usr/local/lib/
### Now you can create your own source code using the newly created library.
11. Compile your code with
   gcc -o my-program my-code.c -Itypes -Iintfs -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lwiringPi -lnxprdlib
12. Run the program with
   sudo ./my-program
